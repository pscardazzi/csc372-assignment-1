    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p> Located in the northeast coast of Brazil, in the state of São Paulo, Ubatuba holds
        a special place in my heart. I used to go here with my parents and family fairly often
        when I was younger, and I have a lot of fond memories of the place. If you're looking for 
        some beachside fun, then this is a good place to visit!
    </p>
    <h2>Must-See Locales</h2>
    <ol>
        <li title="Parking available from 7AM to 7PM BST">Felix Beach: There are many beaches in Ubatuba, but this one takes the cake.
            A big beach with rowdy seas, though it comes with a nice, mellow river 
            as a relaxing sidepiece!
        </li>
        <li title="Check with nearby services for avilability">Selinha Island: (Probably) the smallest island in the world! Take a boat ride,
            or go snorkel diving there is you're experienced!
        </li>
